# Discord_OpenAI_ChatBot
## A **Python** project that leverages Discord, and OpenAI APIs to build a Discord chatbot powered by OpenAI's large language models.
This project has 3 main python files:
- main.py is the driving code and ensures that the project can only be run by directly running main.py
- discord_api.py is the code that controls how the discord bot sends and receives messages to and from the user through the Discord API
- openai.py is the code that controls how the messages to and from the user are parsed and sent and received through the OpenAI API

This project accomplishes the following:
- Sets private keys/tokens to be used for API retrieval
- Performs API retrievals to send and receive messages to and from the user
- Leverages OpenAI LLM frameworks to accomplish advanced chatbot responses

## How to tweak this project for your own uses
I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project to use for your own purposes. It's a good introduction to API retrievals.

## Known issues (Work in progress)
This project is still no longer ongoing. You will need a paid account with OpenAI to access their API. Additionally main.py needs to be run from a terminal to avoid having to deal with loop synchronization issues.
